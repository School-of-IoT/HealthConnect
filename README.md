# HealthConnect

From this Project, we are trying to analyze the problems faced by people while performing their tests and finding a diagnostics solution for it after the results of the lab tests are given.  

All these tests need not be taken in the hospitals, an IoT device, whose prototype that we have built can track and upload the data to the cloud. This data can be analyzed on a  Machine learning Algorithm and cross-reference to find the accurate anomalies in the patient's body. 

These could include infection, disorders, diseases, or any health condition which is unlikely in usual cases.

The focus is on having a portable ICU, with which the medical help can be reached to the people remotely.
